Vector Space and Applications
=============================

Introduction
------------

This course is designed to introduce graduate students to key concepts from advanced linear algebra that are 
used regularly in ECE/CS journal papers on signal processing, communications, circuit design, and machine learning.  
It is suitable for first-year graduate students (MS and PhD) and advanced undergraduates.  For each topic, the course 
will present the key mathematical ideas (and their proof) and then demonstrate how these ideas are applied in practice.  
The goal is to use application topics such as Markov chains, alternating projections, and pattern classification to 
illustrate important mathematical topics. The mathematical topics will include: Logic/set theory; metric spaces; 
continuity, convergence, and separability in metric spaces; inner-product spaces and Hilbert spaces; operators 
in finite and infinite dimensional vector spaces; representation, best approximation, and optimal filtering; 
eigensystems, spectral theorems, and singular value decomposition.
